## Overview

MCPdirect Studio is a desktop application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Desktop. It provides developers with a comprehensive suite of tools to connect, manage, and monitor "MCP" (Model-View-Controller Platform) servers. The application simplifies the workflow for tasks such as logging, permission management, and API key administration.

## Features

* **Connect MCP:** The core feature of the application, allowing users to add, monitor, and manage MCP servers. It supports both "stdio" and "sse" server types.
* **Agent Keys:** Manage API keys for connecting to MCP servers. Users can generate, view, enable/disable, and revoke keys.
* **Tool Permission:** Fine-grained permission control for each API key, allowing users to specify which tools a key can access.
* **Offline Key Persistence:** Keys generated while offline remain valid and can be used seamlessly after you register or sign in to an account.
* **Multi-Device Support:** A single key can be used to connect and authenticate from multiple different devices or AI agents simultaneously.
* **Tools Logbook:** Logs the usage of various tools, providing insights from both "manufacturer" and "agent" perspectives.
* **Settings:**
    * Customize device information such as name and tags.
    * Manage your account, including password changes and logout.
* **DIY Tools:** (Coming Soon) This feature is currently under development.
